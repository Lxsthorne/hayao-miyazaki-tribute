# hayao-miyazaki-tribute

This project was created as part of the FCC.com front-end development challenges. 
The criteria for this challenge was to build a tribute page using HTML and CSS. 
The page had to use:
- at least one flexbox or grid
- include at least one link to an external source
- and supply sufficient content on the subject
